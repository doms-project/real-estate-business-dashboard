# Logo Setup Instructions

To add the Tenn Men Holdings logo:

1. Save your logo image as `tenn-men-logo.png` in the `/public` folder
2. The logo should be square (recommended: 512x512px or 1024x1024px)
3. The logo will automatically appear in the sidebar header

If the logo file doesn't exist, the sidebar will show "Tenn Men AI" text as a fallback.
